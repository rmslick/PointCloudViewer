Sure! Here's an example of a Django project with a single endpoint that returns a "Hello, World!" message:

1. First, make sure you have Django installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install django
```

2. Create a new Django project:

```
django-admin startproject myproject
```

This will create a new directory called `myproject` with the following structure:

```
myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
```

3. Create a new Django app:

```
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

This will create a new directory called `myapp` inside the `myproject` directory.

4. Open `myproject/settings.py` and add `'myapp'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    
    # add your app here
    'myapp',
]
```

5. Open `myproject/urls.py` and add a new route to your app:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

6. Create a new file called `myapp/views.py` with the following content:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse

def hello(request):
    return JsonResponse({'message': 'Hello, World!'})
```

This defines a view function that returns a JSON response with a "Hello, World!" message.

7. Create a new file called `myapp/urls.py` with the following content:

```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello),
]
```

This defines a new route for your app that maps to the `hello` view.

8. Run the development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:8000/`.

9. Test your API:

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/myapp/hello/`. You should see a JSON response with a "Hello, World!" message.

For the sandbox, you could use something like the Python `exec` function to execute the user's code in a sandboxed environment. However, this can be dangerous if you don't properly restrict the user's access to system resources. There are also existing libraries like `PySandbox` and `PyExecJS` that can help you create a safe sandbox environment for running untrusted code.
